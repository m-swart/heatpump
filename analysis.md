# Energy comsumption of a heatpump during the winter
In this small report, the data collected from the heatpump will be anaysed and evaluated. The goal of the report is inform readers whom may be considering to get a heatpump as an alternative heatpump. In the report, energy usage of the heatpump will be discussed and how much the cost can be when running the heatpump daily. Furthermore an explanation why an heatpump can use high amounts of energy during the winter.

### Validity of the analysis
All the information used for this analysis comes from one singular heatpump. Therefore the validaty of the anaylsis can be questioned. However just recent, the heatpump had control, and came through with no mehcnical problems. The type of heatpump used for this project provides heating for a family of 4, is a ground-source heatpump and uses 2.6 kwh to heat 207m squared of housing, however can the analysis of the data collected be useful for everybody. Why? this is because this winter had a diversification of temperatures providing a lot of instresing trends in correlation between outside temperature and operational hours of the heatpump.
